# Versioning

The version numbers to be used must follow the format given in the table below. Note that the format is different for
CSM 1.4.x releases because this convention is decided after the CSM 1.4.0 release but before the 1.5.0 release, so it was
not possible to change the convention for a previously released product.

| CSM Version | .version file in cray-nls | Helm chart version in cray-nls-charts |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1.4.x       | 0.(10+x).y                | 2.(10+x).y                            |
| 1.5.x       | 3.(1+x).y                 | 3.(1+x).y                             |
| 1.6.x       | 4.x.y                     | 4.x.y                                 |
